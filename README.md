# RPS_Simulation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `code.py` script lists hyperparameters for the simulation that can be edited; noteworthy ones being: number of balls, the ball radius, the arena radius, the ball maximum initial speed.

When run, the simulation runs until all balls are of the same species, and the winner is flagged.
